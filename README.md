#### Note: application tested only on android, on ios it was not tested

## Prerequisites

Follow the [official guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to properly setup your environment.
We highly recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) instead of brew or aptitude to install nodejs.

## Proyect Set Up

### One time setup

#### ENV setup
------------
create the `.env` file on the root.
```
BASE_URL=https://XXXXXXXX

ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXX

```

Where the `ACCESS_KEY` is the debug url api.

Then create the `.env.production` file on the root too, with the same data that the last,
but the `BASE_URL` must be the production url api.

#### Install dependencies: 

`yarn` or `npm i`
-----------

## Running aplication

`npx react-native start`

ANDROID

`npx react-native run-android`

ANDROID
`npx react-native run-android` and then:
1. CommandâŒ˜ + M to launch the developer menu in Android emulator.

## Outputs

### Android
Use the the command in the rootpath to generate the APK:
```

If you want to test that file in a plugged devise use the command `npm run android:install` to install it.
